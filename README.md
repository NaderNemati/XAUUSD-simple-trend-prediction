# XAUUSD Trend Prediction using LSTM Neural Network

Welcome to the XAUUSD Trend Prediction repository, where we delve into the world of financial forecasting using the power of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. This project is a humble attempt to harness the capabilities of deep learning to predict and analyze trends in the XAUUSD (Gold/US Dollar) forex market.

## Exploring Forex Trend Prediction

The main focus of this endeavor is to leverage LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network, to predict and compare trends in the XAUUSD market. By utilizing historical price data spanning from 2015 to 2019 as a training set, and data from the end of 2019 to the end of 2020 as a testing set, we aim to build a predictive model that sheds light on potential market movements.

## Leveraging LSTM for Time Series Analysis

LSTM neural networks are particularly well-suited for time series analysis due to their ability to capture and understand sequential patterns in data. Through careful model architecture design and training, we seek to gain insights into the behavior of XAUUSD prices and their trends, thereby facilitating informed decision-making in the dynamic forex landscape.

## Collaborative Experimentation on Google Colab

The development of this project took place on Google Colab, a convenient and collaborative platform that offers a cloud-based environment for Python programming and machine learning. This choice of platform allows for seamless experimentation, efficient code development, and collaborative exploration of the XAUUSD trend prediction model.

## Engage and Explore

As you navigate this repository, you'll find the Python code that constructs, trains, and evaluates the LSTM model. Feel free to delve into the intricacies of the codebase, modify parameters, experiment with different training periods, and expand the analysis further. The aim is not only to predict trends but also to gain a deeper understanding of the intricacies of forex market dynamics.

## Collaborate and Contribute
